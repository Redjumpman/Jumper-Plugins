# Jumper Cogs

[<img align="right" src="http://i.imgur.com/oNPyK9t.png">](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DYU6WYL5K5YML)

These cogs are designed to work with Red Bot designed by Twentysix26 and the Cog Creators team.    
Some cogs will require a third party library to work, so please read over my requirements.txt and the info.json file before using.  
Please stay tuned for all the latest stuff from jumper-cogs on my [Dev Tracker](https://github.com/Redjumpman/Jumper-Cogs/issues/76)  
If you wish to donate please click on the donation jar. TY :D  
I accept commission work, but please contact me on discord for details.

## Installation

To install my cogs add my repo with the following command:  
```cog repo add jumper-cogs https://github.com/Redjumpman/Jumper-Cogs```  
Then check to see if the cog has any library dependencies and peform a pip3 install.  
Please look over the installation section and my wiki for more details on library installations  

## Library Requirements
Library requirements should be automatically downloaded and installed. However, if you wish to download the requirements manually please
follow these steps:

Review the library requirements in the info.json file within the cog's folder. If you do not have the library downloaded it will prompt you with a message telling you what to do.

To install a library follow these instructions:
```
- Open command prompt
- Type pip3 install "Library name"   Example: pip3 install tabulate
- Press enter and let the library load
- Once this has loaded you just need to install the cog or reload it!
```  
For more information please view my wiki page
